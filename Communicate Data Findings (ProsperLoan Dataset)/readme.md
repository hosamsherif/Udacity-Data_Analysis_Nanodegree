## Dataset

The prosperLoan Dataset consists of 113937 observation and 81 features , 
From my understanding to the variables , I've choosen only some of the 81 features to support my findings which are 
these features: ProsperScore, ProsperRating (Alpha) ,Term , StatedMonthlyIncome , LoanOriginalAmount , 
LoanStatus , EmploymentStatus , BorrowerAPR ,BorrowerRate , LenderYield , EstimatedReturn


## Summary of Findings

- The distributions of ProsperRating & ProsperScore are almost normally distributed
- We can see that the individuals with the 12 month term loan seems to have a higher prosper score median than others 
, we also can see that the individuals with the highest prosper rating are quailfied to the leargest loan amounts , 
  we can also see that the individuals with full time employment status has the highest prosper score among all
  other employment status
- I observed that the stated montly income and loan original amount seems to be correlated with each other 
  when the prosper rating is high (AA-A-B) , and there is no correlation between stated montly income 
  and loan original amount when the prosper rating is low 

## Key Insights for Presentation

 which are ProsperScore and ProsperRating , I also plotted the relation between the main features and the
 other chosen features to conclude meaningful insights regarding the dataset ,
 I tried to use all the Design of visualization rules such as Design integerity , High-data to ink ratio.
